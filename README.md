# Hussar
Framework for those who would like to stick to JS only (no HTML nor CSS) and produce relatively fast and fairly small sized web apps

## NOTE
This is Work In Progress (WIP), anything might be subject of change at any time.

At current stage it starts to be usable:
* you can create components
* you can create and attach styles
* you can do two-way bindings
* you can use efficient lifecycle events
* there are included libraries with usefull generic JS functionalities

## Goals of this framework
- Pure Javascript only for everything
- Produce small code
- Produce fast code

## Documentation
Documentation is available here (also a VERY WIP version):
https://danielmazurkiewicz.github.io/hussar/

Documentation itself uses this framework so for now it can give you a glympse of how to use it.
